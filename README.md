# Modeling Social Vulnerability to Malaria – a (spacially explicit) system dynamics approach  
Millions of people fall ill with malaria every year – most of them are located in sub-Saharan Africa. A substantial share of the affected are characterized by a general lack of anticipation - and coping capacities, which renders them especially vulnerable to the disease and its side-effects. The malaria system is made up of interrelations and feedback loops among a number of environ-
mental and social factors, such as poverty, awareness and education. This project is dedicated to the identification of interdependencies and feedback mechanisms among a selected set of social, economic and biological factors associated with increased vulnerability to malaria, in five East-African Nations. The results, obtained through quantitative statistical analysis, are presented in the form of Causal Loop Diagrams which are interpreted based on literature review. The working hypothesis was, that the systemic structures among the vulnerability factors vary over space and can therefore not be depicted in just one Causal Loop Diagram. To prove the hypothesis, the study area has been clustered into groups of relatively homogenous underlying structures and Causal Loop Diagrams for each cluster have been generated. The results confirm, that the systemic structures do in fact vary throughout space and one Causal Loop Diagram can not sufficiently reflect these variations.

# Modeling social vulnerability to malaria in East Africa – a (spatially explicit) system-dynamics approach

The Anopheles mosquito is causing millions of people to fall ill with malaria every year– most of them are located in sub-Saharan Africa as well as in parts of Asia. A substantial share of the affected are characterized by generic susceptibilities and a general lack of anticipation, coping and recovery capacities, which renders them especially vulnerable to the disease and its side-effects. 

The malaria system consists of interrelations and feedback loops among a number of environmental factors, such as land-use, daily temperatures, and precipitation – as well as socio-economic factors like poverty, awareness, and education.

Therefore, this project is concerned with the identification of feedback loops among the drivers of malaria risk and a selected set of ecological, social and economic factors, combining statistical analysis and a participatory system-dynamics modeling approach. 
The research builds on data generated during the course of the HEALTHY FUTURES Project, which was in parts concerned with the identification of regions in Kenya, Tanzania, Ruanda, Burundi, and Uganda - which carry a high malaria-burden. Detached from administrative boundaries, regions with homogenous characteristics (so-called Geons) were delineated and given composite risk-indices in order to quantify the burden. Risk was calculated based on the Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) as a proxy for the intensity of malaria transmission, complemented by 14 vulnerability indicators reflecting the socioeconomic and biological dimensions. 

The purpose of this project is to generate a system-dynamics model with the support of causal loop diagrams (‘impact chains’), which is supposed to shed light on the possible future development of risk and vulnerability indicators, by revealing their mutual dependencies and by utilizing existing EIR predictions. One of the key objectives is to supplement the spatial “Geons-View” by a spatiotemporal perspective of malaria risk in this region.
