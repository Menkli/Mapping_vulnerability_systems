# Modeling Social Vulnerability to Malaria – a (spacially explicit) system dynamics approach  
Every year, an estimated 400 Mio. humans fall ill with malaria – most of them are located in sub-saharan Africa. A substantial share of the affected are characterized by a general lack of anticipation- and coping capacities, which renders them especially vulnerable to the disease and its side-effects. This project is concerned with the identification of feedback loops among the presence of malaria and a selected set of social, economical and biological factors prevailing in the communities. The project builds on the results of the Healthy Futures Project, which was concerned with the identification of regions that carry a high malaria-burden. Regions with homogenous characteristics (so called Geons) of five countries in East Africa were delineated and given composite risk-indexes in order to quantify the burden. The risk index was calculated based on 14 different vulnerability indicators and results from the VECTRI model as a proxi for hazard. The VECTRI model predicts the EIR (Entomological Incoulation Rate) for this area for the years 2055 and 2095 based on two different climate change scenarios (and other factors). The importance of the 14 vulnerability indicators were rated by 7 experts from different related fields and weighted accordingly in the analysis. However, while the EIR in the Geons varies between the presence and the years 2055 and 2095, the data of the vulnerability indicators were not changed for the predicted Geons. The objective of this project is to identify the connections between the vulnerability indicators and the hazard indicator EIR, combining statistical analysis and a participatory modeling approach. A model is developed which is supposed to help predict the future development of the vulnerability indicators, based on the predictions for the EIR from the VECTRI model. In the end, not only the EIR should be changed in the predicted Geons, but also the other vulnerability indicators are supposed to change. The model will be developed utilizing GAMA and R. 

Millions of people fall ill with malaria every year– most of them are located in sub-saharan Africa. A substantial share of the affected are characterized by a general lack of anticipation- and coping capacities, which renders them especially vulnerable to the disease and its side-effects. 
The malaria system is made up of interrelations and feedback loops among a number of environmental and social factors, such as poverty, awareness and education. Therefore, this project is concerned with the identification the feedback loops among the presence of malaria and a selected set of social, economic and biological factors, combining statistical analysis and a participatory system-dynamics modeling approach. The project builds on data generated during the course of the Healthy Futures Project, which was in parts concerned with the identification of regions in Kenya, Tanzania, Ruanda, Burundi and Uganda which carry a high malaria-burden. Detached from administrative boundaries, regions with homogenous characteristics (so called Geons) were delineated and given composite risk-indexes in order to quantify the burden. The risk index was calculated based on the Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) as a proxi for the intensity of malaria transmission and 14 vulnerability indicators reflecting the socioeconomic and biological dimensions. 
The purpose of this project is to generate a system-dynamics model which is supposed to shed light on the possible future development of the vulnerability indicators, by revealing their mutual dependencies and by utilizing existing EIR predictions. One of the key objectives will be the analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of malaria risk in this region.
