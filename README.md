# Modeling Social Vulnerability to Malaria – a (spacially explicit) system dynamics approach  
Every year, an estimated 400 Mio. humans fall ill with malaria – most of them are located in sub-saharan Africa. A substantial share of the affected are characterized by a general lack of anticipation- and coping capacities, which renders them especially vulnerable to the disease and its side-effects. This project is concerned with the identification of feedback loops among the presence of malaria and a selected set of social, economical and biological factors prevailing in the communities. The project builds on the results of the Healthy Futures Project, where regions with homogenous characteristics (so called Geons) of five countries in East Africa were delineated and given composite risk-indexes. The risk index was calculated based on 14 different vulnerability indicators and results from the VECTRI model as a proxi for hazard. The VECTRI model predicts the EIR (Entomological Incoulation Rate) for this area for the years 2055 and 2095 based on two different climate change scenarios (and other factors). The importance of the 14 vulnerability indicators were rated by 7 experts from different related fields and weighted accordingly in the analysis. However, while the EIR in the Geons varies between the presence and the years 2055 and 2095, the data of the vulnerability indicators were not changed for the predicted Geons. The objective of this project is to identify the connections between the vulnerability indcators and the hazard indocator EIR, combining statistical analysis and a participatory modeling approach. A model is developed which is supposed to help predict the future development of the vulnerability indicators, based on the predictions for the EIR from the VECTRI model. In the end, not only the EIR should be changed in the predicted Geons, but also the other vulnerability indicators are supposed to change. The model will be developed utilizing GAMA and R.
